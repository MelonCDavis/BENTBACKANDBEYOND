responsive tattoo website
Hello and thank you for looking!
My name is Melon Davis and I have been tattooing since 2004. I'm going to continue to tattoo while I get the coding bootcamp finished up and until I have actually solidified myself in something of a tech job that's real ish.
This site is an "about me" resource for advertising my tattoo art, telling my story, providing resources for clients and in the end selling art that I make that aren't tattoos. I can use this with other social media and links from other sources to help drive business to me as long as I continue to work in the field of tattoo art.
This site was built almost entirely using bootstrap and html only. When the time came to add a few interactive items and update fonts I used css to finish it off. I KNOW for a fact that I could have used css to make it much less heavy in the HTML department but I was trying to learn bootstrap first and foremost.  I feel it was more important to drive home to elements of bootstrap and dig in that way than to make it easier with the css.  ....and that is why I did it.
